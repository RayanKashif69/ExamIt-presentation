## Development Process and Retrospective

<section class="info-card focus-card">
  <p>
    Throughout the development of ExamIt, we followed Agile practices involving iterative sprints, retrospectives, and collaborative planning. This approach allowed us to continuously refine our work and adapt based on feedback. We also experienced firsthand the impact of technical debt, version control collaboration, and teamwork under deadlines.
